# DevFinder.tsx

A week ago, i started learning **@reactjs** docs for the first time. first of all, the point was understanding what's exactly the change this library come up with.
I am the type who can't learn things without practicing, so i decided to build this project and try to implement wath i learn !

The main things that i learned throught this are what we call *Hooks* in **react** :
1. useState.
2. useEffect.<br>
I just started using these two hooks above in JSX in the previous repos (feel free to check it) then i challanged my self to rework the whole project with **@typescript**/TSX, and also to implement a new thing that i found very useful for me is :
- useContext.<br>
Untill the moment, i really like the clarity of **react**'s docs and i'am looking forward to claiming maximum knowledge on them!
